## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

blr.today is an open-source project by Nemo that curates events happening in Bangalore.
It curates events from multiple sources, cleans them up, then curates them further by tagging them nicely, and makes all event data available as calendars you can subscribe to.

If you'd like to contribute to the project, take a look at our [roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/blr-today/projects/1/views/4). This is still a very early project and our
doc/guides aren't as good as we'd like. If you'd like to try contributing - a good place is to open issues for new event sources to track.
